Network Diagnostic Script (Windows Users)

Download the [Last Version](https://github.com/redcursor/nd/releases) of the script.  
Go to **w** directory and run **main.bat** file.  
The script will ask for your:  
+ Domain Name
+ IP address

Enter them and hit the *Enter key*.

A `txt` file is created, you can send that file to your Web Hosting Support Team.

NOTE:  
I know that `.bat` scripting has been deprecated, but since it is the only one available for almost all Windows users, it will be the first choice.  
And please do not say why did not you use PowerShell! You know what.
